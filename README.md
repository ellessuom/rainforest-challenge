# Rainforest challenge

This project provides a simple yet effective script for the Rainforest Challenge. 
The decision to present this solution as a repository, rather than a standalone script, stems from the necessity of a specific environment for its execution. 
It requires TypeScript Compiler (TSC) and node-fetch to function correctly, and the repository format conveniently bundles these requirements, streamlining the setup process and ensuring seamless operation.

## Instructions

Ensure you're using `node v20`, with that proceed by installing the project's dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

And finally:
```bash
npm start
```
